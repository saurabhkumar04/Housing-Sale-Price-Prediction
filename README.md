         Contrary to the widespread belief that house prices are dependent on the generic factors like number of bedrooms
         and square area of house, Ames Housing dataset proves that many other factors influence the final price of homes.
         This dataset contains 79 explanatory variables to describe almost every aspect of the house. Generally house buyers
         neglect this information. As a result their price estimation is very different from actual prices. I build a model
         to predict the prices of residential homes in, Ames, Iowa, using advanced regression techniques. This will provide
         buyers will a rough estimate of what the houses are actually worth. This in turn will help them have better negotiation
         deals with sellers. 

    methodology:
        I first analyzed the data and for finding trends in data. Then I performed dimensionality reduction on the dataset using
        PCA algorithm and feature_selection module in sklearn package for python. The final house prices are predicted using linear
        regression models like Ridge and Lasso. Advanced regression techniques, like gradient boosting using XGBoost
        library in python, was also used.
